Stocker is a simple program to deliver near real time stock quotes to the
Android platform. This project is meant to be a prototype since Google will
probably deliver a quote program with the full release of Android.  Currently 
the client runs on Android and makes calls to a server which runs one a slow linux 
system over a DSL line.  If there is sufficent interest more documentation
will follow.  Otherwise... on to new and better things.
